## Getting started
First, navigate to the repository root folder.

To generate a random 10MB, run (for more details, you can inspect the script):

`sh generate-randomfile.sh`

This will create a new file, *randomfile*. To hash it using md5, you can run:

`sh generate-hash.sh`

This will create a new file, *randomfile-hash*. Again, the script itself contains a few more usage details.
